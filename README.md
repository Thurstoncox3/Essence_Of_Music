## Usage
The user will be presented with the Essence of Music login page initially. If this is the first time the User is signing in, they will be asked to create a profile. Once the profile is established, they will be presented with our Music Genre page, where they can select from our options of Pop, Country, Hip-Hop, etc.

One the user has selected the genre, they can select an artist, a song, or even a clip of the artist music video. If the User likes the song, click the "like" button to save the song into your My Playlist library. These songs will be saved for when the user logs back into the EOM page.
